This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset. The performance becomes very slow, especially when scrolling, and the app may become unresponsive. This is because FlatList renders all items at once by default, which is inefficient for large datasets.  The solution involves using the `windowSize` and `removeClippedSubviews` props to optimize rendering.
